    <h2 style="color:white;"> Why do i like this movie?</h2>
<p style="color:white;"> There are different reasons why I like this movie so much.</p>
<p style="color:white;"> First of all i love the way they have animated it. They haven't tried to make it realistic, They have chosen for it to let it be really like a cartoon. The way they did that is just awesome</p>
<p style="color:white;"> Secondly the storytelling is great. They start with a quick summary of Miles his life in a funny way and slowly it becomes more serious</p>
<p style="color:white;"> Lastly I just love spiderman movies, I've seem them all and generally I like all of them</p>
